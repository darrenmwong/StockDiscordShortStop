Learning Discord bot setups and eventually setup a bot that can look at a certain stock of the choosing to watch if its shorted. IE if a stock starts dropping X amount which will be set inside discord args, !ticket GME 230(current) 180(Stop Limit) then itll keep checking. Also initially wanted to make it so for eveery minute it checks against the old price set and if < || > X amount 30 points in example, Pings the server to notify that the stock is moving dramatically(because im lazy and i dont want to stare at the graph all day). k thx bye
